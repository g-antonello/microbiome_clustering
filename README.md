# microbiome_clustering

methods to cluster microbiome data, both for counts and for relative abundance data. The methods are mainly **Dirichlet Multinomial Clustering**, **WGCNA**, a more classic hierarchical clustering that relies on beta diversity estimation, for a start.

# Dirichlet Multinomial 

This is based on the following [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030126), in my implementation, I have a three-step approach that aims to make a command line interface to run. 


# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

One of the new kids in the block by Susan and her group, see this [link](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/20/4/599/5032578) for the statistical underpinning.
